"Forestry

Sentinel-1 can play an important role in sustainable forest management with clear-cut and partial-cut detection, forest type classification, biomass estimation and disturbance detection. For climate change, mapping of forest fire scars can be an important part of mapping the carbon history of a forest and plays a critical role in the estimation of carbon emissions. Land cover maps can be used to support forest management and the monitoring of illegal timber harvesting worldwide.

For this application the most suitable product is the Interferometric Wide with dual polarisation. In fact, the cross -polarisation VH is more sensitive to change in vegetation density and structure while the polarisation ratio VH/VV is an important index for vegetation phenology or water content (European Wide Forest Classification Based on Sentinel-1 Data)."
